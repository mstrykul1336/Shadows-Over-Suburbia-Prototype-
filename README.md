# Shadows Over Suburbia Prototype 
9/17/24:
Tasks: 
- Figure out which multiplayer engine to use. (Unity or Proton? More than likely Proton, but I will be watching a beginner's video to Unity multiplayer to see if I like it. This is the video: https://youtu.be/E9eHefMpVnM?si=_1fXScONaJZOLwzG) 
- Get multiplayer lobby running where players can join a lobby and queue up for a game.
- Get text chat working for players
- Have a login page for players 
- Assign basic roles to players (no abilities yet, just basic roles)
- Set up a day and night cycle.
- Work out basic and functional UI (text box, leave button, list of players, basic square icons, health)
- Have cubes at a circle table, but no movement yet. 
- Establish a day and night cycle, but no scene changes yet. Just have them in the same room for now.
- Establish winning and losing based on what roles are left. 
- For now, just give the option to attack someone at night. 
- Set up heart system. 
- Simple instructions on what roles are and what their winning condition is. 
What was completed:
- Added multiplayer lobby functionality (two different types, one works better than the other)
- Made a game scene that breaks because the old lobby was messed up and now it doesn't work with the new lobby.
- Made basic title screen.
- Followed a bad guide that did not work and took up 4-5 hours of my time.
- Also the names don't show up on the lobby because I took the code from an old build in multiplayer that had those not working. Do not know how to fix it like I did last time.
